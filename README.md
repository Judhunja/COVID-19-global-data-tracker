# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project tracks global COVID-19 trends by analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and narrative insights using Python.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries/regions
- Visualize trends with charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook report

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Download the dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) and save it in the project directory.
2. Open the `COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter extension.
3. Run all cells from start to finish to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Insights and Reflections

- The USA has had the highest total cases and deaths among the selected countries.
- India experienced large waves of new cases with significant death tolls.
- Kenya shows lower total cases and deaths but slower vaccination progress.
- Death rate trends fluctuate due to reporting and healthcare factors.
- Vaccination rollouts vary significantly and impact case trends.

Make sure the dataset CSV file is present before running the notebook to avoid errors.
